## Projects

### Spatial Analysis of Charleston Arrest Data 

[project](file:///Users/jonathankelso/Downloads/GEOG364_Independent_Lab_jdk5754-4.html). 

In 2023, I had the opportunity to analyze arrest data from the Charleston Police Department's with the goal of finding spatial patterns that would suggest instances of bias and/or inequality. From this data set, I was successfull in finding instances of clustering in the city, and subsequently investigated what societal factors led to said clustering. This project served as the capstone for my spatial analysis in R course. 



### Machine Learning Prediction Model

Coming soon.
